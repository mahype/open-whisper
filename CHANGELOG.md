# Changelog

All notable changes to TorroWhisper are documented here. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> _TorroWhisper was previously released as **DonnyWhisper** (and before that as **Open Whisper**); entries for 0.4.x and earlier predate the first rename._

## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.3] — 2026-08-03

### Fixed
- **The window design no longer depends on the build machine** — built with the macOS 26 SDK (Xcode 26, now used locally *and* in CI), the app automatically adopted the macOS 26 "Liquid Glass" redesign: the settings sidebar floated as a rounded panel inside the window instead of running flush to the window edges, and toolbar and controls changed with it. Older SDKs kept the classic look, so the layout flip-flopped between local builds and CI releases. `UIDesignRequiresCompatibility` in the Info.plist now pins the classic pre-Tahoe design regardless of the build SDK; macOS before 26 ignores the key. Apple honors it for one major release only — before macOS 27 the app must adopt the new design deliberately, then the key goes away.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- **Permissions can be granted where they are diagnosed** — microphone and accessibility access could only be handed over in the onboarding wizard. Afterwards, Settings → Diagnostics reported a missing grant as a collapsed card whose only advice was prose ("enable TorroWhisper under Microphone in System Settings → Privacy & Security"), leaving the user to hunt for a switch the app could have flipped itself. Cards with a warning or an error now start expanded, and the two permission entries carry the same button the wizard offers — it triggers the native prompt when macOS has not asked yet, otherwise it deep-links straight into the matching privacy pane, and the diagnosis re-reads itself afterwards.

### Changed
- **The log file moved to Diagnostics** — log access and the diagnostics snapshot sat under Help while the status cards they belong to lived in Diagnostics. Support material for one problem now stands in one place.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-19

### Added
- **Live transcription while recording** (#41) — the recording bubble now shows what you are saying as you say it. A single streaming worker keeps re-transcribing the growing take (~every 750 ms, first result after ~0.9 s of detected speech), a stabilizer splits the hypotheses into committed text (rendered bright, append-only — it never changes once shown) and a still-revising pending tail (rendered dimmed), and the bubble grew to host it: a slim waveform strip on top, up to three transcript lines beneath it — newest words always visible — and the familiar status row below. When you pause, the dimmed tail finishes committing after ~1.5 s (there is nothing left for Whisper to revise); snapshots always end at the last heard speech so Whisper never decodes into trailing silence, where it hallucinates filler. Only the final full Whisper pass after the recording ends is ever inserted into the target app, silence-only takes run zero inference, and streaming inference aborts instantly when the recording stops so the final pass never waits. Settings → Recording indicator offers the display as a strict either/or — *Waveform (focus on speaking)*, the classic pre-#41 bubble with no preview inference, or *Live text (read while dictating)*, the default: a pure reading surface (420×180, no waveform, no 30 Hz level polling). The bubble itself can no longer be turned off; the old visibility toggle is gone (`show_recording_indicator` remains in the settings file as a legacy no-op). The preview requires the warmed-up model cache (#43), so a dictation started seconds after launch may begin without the preview and pick it up mid-take.

### Fixed
- **Mixed-language settings window in the dev loop** — `scripts/dev.sh` launched the bare executable, where `Bundle.main` finds no `de.lproj` at all: the whole UI silently fell back to English while the Rust bridge, which resolves its language from the system locale itself, kept sending German status text. The dev loop now stages the same `Contents/Resources` payload the packaged `.app` gets. Shipped builds were never affected.
- **No more hallucinated farewells appended to a dictation** (#41) — Whisper, trained heavily on video/subtitle material, hallucinates outro filler when it decodes into the trailing silence of a take that ends with a pause: "Vielen Dank", "Mit freundlichen Grüßen", "Untertitel von …", even "Bis zum nächsten Mal im ZDF". The live preview already truncated snapshots at the last heard speech, but the authoritative *final* pass still decoded the whole buffer — so the garbage landed in the inserted text even though the preview looked clean. The final pass now truncates trailing silence the same way (last voiced sample + 800 ms padding, kept in full when no speech was ever detected so a quiet take is never lost). As a safety net over any residual pause, a conservative blocklist strips known subtitle/broadcast outros from the transcript tail — deliberately *not* ambiguous phrases a user might genuinely dictate (a bare "Vielen Dank", "Mit freundlichen Grüßen"), which are handled by the silence trim alone.
- **Spurious Whisper aborts under streaming** — whisper-rs 0.16's `set_abort_callback_safe` casts its stored closure back with the wrong type and reads garbage, which made inference passes abort at random with encode error -6. The streaming worker wires the ggml abort callback manually against the session's stop flag instead.
- **Live preview stuck in the wrong language** — with the transcription language on *auto*, Whisper detects the language per pass, and on the first short pass (1–2 s of audio) it can guess wrong (e.g. English for German speech) and then effectively *translate* the dictation; the stabilizer froze that wrong-language text for the whole take. Detection converges as the buffer grows, so on a language flip the preview now resets and rebuilds instead of freezing. The final pass was never affected.
- **Live preview blind to quiet microphones** — the streaming speech gate reused the auto-stop VAD threshold (RMS ≥ 0.014), which low-gain microphones rarely cross; in practice the bubble showed "Listening…" for a minute while the user was speaking. The gate now also accepts speech that clearly rises above the recording's own tracked noise floor, or a fraction (0.35×) of the VAD threshold — the strict threshold remains untouched for the silence auto-stop.
- **First inference no longer pays the Metal warm-up** — ggml compiles its Metal pipeline cache lazily on the first inference of the process, a multi-second one-time cliff on large models that used to hit the first dictation (or its live preview). The background model warmup (#43) now runs one short silent inference so the cache is hot before the first real pass. The live-preview worker additionally never queues behind another inference (e.g. the final pass of a just-cancelled dictation) — it skips the pass and retries with fresh audio instead.
- **Metal GPU acceleration for Whisper** (#43) — the macOS build now compiles `whisper-rs` with the `metal` feature, so transcription runs on the GPU (Apple Silicon and Intel) instead of the CPU; Windows/Linux keep the CPU-only build via per-target Cargo dependencies. On first model load the log records whether Metal is compiled in (`GPU acceleration: Metal ENABLED`), the bundled whisper.cpp version, and — now that the log filter admits `whisper_rs` output — the ggml Metal init banner (GPU name, backend selection) that proves the GPU is actually used.
- **Per-stage dictation timing** (#43) — every dictation logs a consolidated breakdown from recording stop to inserted text (audio length, model load, resampling, Whisper state creation, Whisper inference, LLM post-processing, text insertion, total, and real-time factor). Whisper and LLM post-processing are timed separately so the diagnostics can tell which one dominates. The latest breakdown is also shown in Settings → Diagnostics.
- **Model & thread benchmark** (#43) — Settings → Diagnostics has a *Run benchmark* button that transcribes a fixed, embedded German reference clip with each installed model (Q5_0 vs FP16 Turbo and others) and across thread counts (1/2/4/6/8), reporting load time, inference time, real-time factor, memory footprint and a rough quality score. Choose the fastest option from measurements instead of assumptions — quantization is not automatically fastest, and with Metal active the CPU thread count barely matters.
- **Background model warmup** (#43) — the active Whisper model is now preloaded in the background after launch and after a model switch, so the first dictation of a session doesn't pay the load cost inline. A "Loading speech model…" hint shows while it warms.
- **Expert Whisper decoding settings** (#43) — Settings → Diagnostics exposes the inference thread count (0 = auto) and a *Force single segment* toggle, both benchmark-informed. A single Whisper inference now runs at a time process-wide, keeping the pipeline ready for a future streaming mode.

### Changed
- **The settings window lost its footer bar** — a permanent strip with a status dot and a *Start dictation* button sat under every pane. The design language has no such thing: what stands on the surface is a decision or an answer, and a process state belongs in the log. Both moved into the Overview pane, where they now form the first card — status dot, "Dictation", the current state in one sentence, and the start/stop button on the right. The other panes are plain native forms again.
- **The wordmark is set in Frutiger again** — *Frutiger LT 95 UltraBlack* is the brand's display cut, and without it TorroWhisper did not look like the rest of the family. The app now ships the cut as a bundle resource and registers it **process-locally**, so it never lands in the user's font book. The file itself stays out of this public repository — it is commercially licensed, is git-ignored, and reaches the release build through a secret. A checkout without it builds and runs unchanged; the wordmark then falls back to the heaviest system cut. UI text remains system text throughout.
- **Status colors are back inside the palette** — the runtime status used `.purple` for post-processing and `.yellow` in the recording bubble, neither of which exists in the design language, and it painted *recording* red, where red means broken or rejected. Only green, orange, red and gray remain, each with its fixed meaning: recording, transcribing and post-processing are the app working as intended and read green — the blinking dot, not a second color, is what says "still working".
- **Sidebar sized to spec** — the fixed 240 pt column is now the specified resizable 200–280 (ideal 220), and the wordmark foot lost its stray `0.85` opacity. `.navigationSplitViewStyle(.balanced)` is gone as well; it was what left the sidebar's reveal chevron floating free in the hero's red.
- **App design-language conformance in Onboarding & Settings** — closing the last gaps against the Torro app design language (`torro-design`, `app-design.md`): the app already used grouped forms, the step rail with numbered brand-red circles, capsule status chips and a single brand-red primary button per footer. Two rules were still violated. The inline "Record" button in the hotkey field was `borderedProminent` (a red-filled button) — the guide reserves the one prominent button per surface for the wizard/sheet footer primary, so it is now a neutral system button. And the runtime status dot in the Settings bottom bar carried its meaning by color alone: it now has a tooltip and is hidden from VoiceOver so the status is announced once as its adjacent text label (design guide "Statuspunkt"; accessibility audit #10).
- **Product-family app icon** — the app icon follows the Torro product-family system from the design repo (`mahype/torro-design`, design guide sections 07/08): the white horns signet on top, a white audio-level glyph (five rounded bars) below, both on the Torro-Red gradient `#D50C0C→#A50A0A` — where the previous icon showed the horns alone on flat red. The source vector is `Resources/Brand/torrowhisper-icon.svg` and `scripts/generate-app-icon.swift` now renders it (unchanged, macOS squircle mask on top) into `AppIcon.icns`. In-app, `TorroLogoTile` (Onboarding, Settings → Help) gains the matching glyph and gradient so it stays the app icon in miniature, backed by a new `TorroWaveform` SwiftUI shape converted 1:1 from the icon's glyph. The menu-bar symbol deliberately stays the `megaphone` template symbol (per the design guide's small-size rule and macOS template-icon expectation).
- **Torro brand design** — the app icon is no longer the blue/violet "OW" placeholder: it is now the Torro signet (two inward-turned horns) on Torro Red `#D50C0C`, generated by `scripts/generate-app-icon.swift` straight from the brand vector, with only the macOS squircle mask added on top. The UI accent moved from the system accent (blue) to the brand red, and the onboarding rail and Settings → Help now lead with the logo. The menu-bar symbol deliberately stays the `megaphone` template symbol — macOS expects monochrome template icons there, and a red logo would break out of the menu bar and be illegible at 16 pt. Brand vectors live in `apps/torrowhisper-macos/Resources/Brand/`, the rules in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). The brand fonts are commercially licensed and are never committed here; the UI keeps using the system font (the wordmark's display cut ships as a git-ignored bundle resource — see above).

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-14

### Added
- **Abnormal-shutdown detection** — a session marker file is written on launch and removed on clean shutdown (a new `applicationWillTerminate` also flushes pending settings autosaves and logs the quit). If the marker is still present at the next launch, the previous session died without reaching the shutdown path — a native abort (e.g. a GGML assertion) or a kill that bypasses the Rust panic hook — and a warning with its start time and pid is logged. Accessory apps get no macOS crash dialog, so this is often the only trace such deaths leave.
- **whisper.cpp / GGML output in the app log** — whisper.cpp and GGML write to stderr, which is lost in a bundled app, including the error lines emitted right before a failed `GGML_ASSERT` aborts the process. whisper-rs's logging hooks now funnel that output through the shared file logger; the existing filter passes warn+ for foreign targets, keeping GGML's chatty model-load info out of the log.

### Changed
- **Renamed to TorroWhisper** — the application, the bundle identifier (now `com.gettorro.TorroWhisper`), the on-disk data and Keychain locations, and the Sparkle update feed were all renamed from *DonnyWhisper*. Existing installs do **not** auto-migrate: reinstall TorroWhisper, then re-grant microphone and accessibility permissions and re-enter any cloud API keys.
- **Renamed to DonnyWhisper** (from *Open Whisper*) — the application, the bundle identifier (then `com.getdonny.DonnyWhisper`), the on-disk data and Keychain locations, and the Sparkle update feed were all renamed. Existing installs did not auto-migrate. (Superseded by the TorroWhisper rename above.)

### Fixed
- **Hotkey capture no longer triggers dictation** — while recording a new shortcut in Settings or Onboarding, the global hotkeys are temporarily unregistered. Previously the armed hotkey was consumed system-wide: pressing it started dictation instead of reaching the capture field, and with no Whisper model installed the blocked-model bubble popped up over the settings window and swallowed Escape, blocking the capture entirely. The registration is restored on commit, cancel, and clear.
- **Runaway idle CPU** — `AppModel.poll()` reassigned its published state and rebuilt every open SwiftUI window and all four status-bar menus every 350 ms even when nothing had changed, which macOS flagged as a sustained-CPU resource violation while the app sat idle. The polled DTOs are now `Equatable` and state is only reassigned (and observers notified) when something actually changed.

### Removed
- **Voice-chat plugin removed to focus on dictation** — the chat window (conversation sidebar, streaming answers, voice input), the Hermes agent integration, the local Piper text-to-speech (sherpa-onnx subprocess), the speech-output settings section, and the plugin overview are gone; TorroWhisper concentrates fully on dictation for now (#34). The shared language-model layer for post-processing (local GGUF, Ollama, LM Studio, cloud providers) is untouched. Settings written by chat-era versions still load — the obsolete fields (`chat`, `speech_output`, `hermes_agents`, `plugins`, `enabled_speech_output_ids`) are simply ignored. Stored chat conversations (`sessions.json`) and downloaded Piper voices/CLI under the app's `tts` data directory are no longer read; delete them manually to reclaim space. The feature can be revived later from branch `feat/chat-plugin` and issue #17.

## [0.4.2] — 2026-06-13

### Added
- **Model file integrity checks** — a model now only counts as "downloaded" when its file passes a size and ggml-magic-header check, validated on recording start, before loading the Whisper context, and in the status views, so both ends of the pipeline agree. Downloads are verified end-to-end (byte count against Content-Length and expected size plus header) before activation; incomplete or damaged files fail and clean up instead of being kept.
- **Corruption recovery** — a damaged model surfaces a *Corrupt* state with a warning and a *Download again* action that removes the damaged file first. Leftover `*.part` files from interrupted downloads are cleaned up on launch.
- **Diagnostics logging for support** — a *Write diagnostics to log* button in Settings → Diagnostics appends a full snapshot (bridge version, settings summary, hotkey and dictation state, last error, and the Whisper + language-model inventories), and the `models`/`diag` log targets now reach the log file, with download lifecycle and free-disk reporting.

### Changed
- **Relicensed from MIT to GPL-3.0-or-later.** The project is still in early development with no released users beyond a couple of testers, and copyleft better fits the goal of keeping derivatives open. A practical upside: a GPL application may incorporate the LGPL-3.0 LAME encoder, so MP3 export stays as-is without the licensing friction it had under MIT.

### Fixed
- **Stale model-path pin** — an older version pinned the active preset's absolute default path into `local_model_path`; after a preset switch that pin pointed at a never-downloaded file, so the UI reported the model present while dictation failed with "has not been downloaded yet". The bridge and the Swift preset switch no longer pin preset defaults, and existing stale pins migrate away on launch, so affected machines self-heal.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- **Show in Finder** — the *Save to disk* section gains a button that opens the configured save folder in Finder, and the save-folder picker now allows creating new folders directly.
- **Last update check visible** — Settings → Updates shows when Sparkle last checked for updates, and the auto-check toggle now reflects the Sparkle setting immediately.
- **Warning when skipping permissions in onboarding** — leaving the permissions step without microphone or accessibility access no longer moves on silently; a dialog names exactly which access is missing, with an explicit *Continue anyway*.

### Fixed
- **Random crashes during transcription** — whisper-rs and llama-cpp-2 each bundle their own, mutually incompatible ggml revision; statically linking both into the app binary silently mixed the two copies, so Whisper could dispatch wrong compute kernels and crash the whole app mid-dictation (the menu bar icon simply vanished). The local post-processing LLM now runs in a separate `torrowhisper-llm-helper` process, giving each library its own consistent ggml. Cancelling post-processing or auto-unloading the model now terminates the helper, which also releases model memory more reliably.
- **Recording bubble no longer burns CPU after hiding** — the hidden bubble kept its blink animation running at 20 fps in an invisible window (~25 % CPU and steadily growing memory until the next restart). The panel is now torn down completely when it hides.
- **Recording bubble no longer pulses in height with the audio level** — the bar-style waveform used a fixed maximum bar height that could exceed the space the layout grants (e.g. with a post-processing mode line shown), so loud input pushed the waveform box taller and quiet passages let it collapse again. Bars now size themselves to the granted space, like the line and envelope styles always did.
- **German UI fully translated** — status texts coming from the Rust core (launch-at-login state, dictation/transcription status, model summaries, diagnostics) were shown in English in the settings footer, the tray status line, VoiceOver announcements, and the diagnostics cards. They are now localized, together with the previously untranslated *Voice Activity Detection* label, the microphone-switch toggles, and the onboarding *Accessibility* tab. Conversely, English users no longer see German placeholder strings during startup.
- **Dev builds no longer block Sparkle updates** — `CFBundleVersion` carried the `git describe` suffix (e.g. `0.4.0-4-gabc123`), which Sparkle compares as newer than every released version, so a locally installed dev build silently swallowed all updates. The suffix is now stripped for the compared version and kept only for display.
- **Sparkle update dialog shows clean release notes** — the appcast embeds the release notes as inline HTML instead of rendering the entire GitHub release web page inside the update window, and the GitHub release is published before the appcast entry so the advertised download URL always exists.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Save dictations to disk** — a new *Save to disk* section under Settings → History optionally writes each completed dictation to a folder you choose: the recording as an MP3 and/or the transcript as a `.txt`, with matching timestamped names. Cancelled dictations are not saved ([#7](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/issues/7)).
- **Accessible recording bubble** — two independent Settings toggles: a *Large view* (~1.7×) for low-vision users and a *High contrast* mode (bolder text, stronger colors). Both default off and combine freely ([#8](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/issues/8)).
- **Onboarding permissions step** — a dedicated step requests microphone and accessibility access up front and confirms once granted, instead of surfacing the prompt only after the first dictation.
- **Permission checks in Diagnostics** — microphone and accessibility authorization now appear as OK/error entries with a hint pointing at the right System Settings pane.
- **File logging, panic hook and structured dictation errors**, with quick access to the log from the Help section, plus an explicit error state in the recording bubble.

### Changed
- **Onboarding no longer auto-downloads models** — the transcription model is downloaded on demand and required to continue; post-processing is optional with a pointer to the language-models manager.
- **Launch at login is a simple yes/no toggle** (in Settings and onboarding) instead of the three-way "ask on first launch" picker.
- **Recording bubble overhaul** — a small stop button replaces the red dot, shortcut hints ("Stop: ⌥⇧S · Cancel: Esc") sit under the model name, a "being cancelled" state is shown, and the layout stays steady across recording/transcribing/post-processing/error so the box no longer jumps. The bubble now reliably appears on the active monitor in multi-display setups ([#9](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/issues/9)).
- **Fewer Whisper hallucinations** — non-speech token suppression cuts the spurious "Vielen Dank" / "Untertitel von …" filler Whisper emits on trailing silence.

### Fixed
- **Escape no longer loses a dictation** — cancelling while still recording now transcribes the captured audio and keeps it in history (marked cancelled) instead of discarding it.
- **System language is detected correctly** — with the UI language set to *System*, a German system now shows German.
- **German localization repaired** — a stray ASCII quote had broken the entire German strings table, falling the whole UI back to English; the build now lints every strings file and fails on a syntax error.
- **Released builds reliably pick up Rust changes** — the app binary is now force-relinked against the freshly built Rust library.

## [0.3.3] — 2026-06-09

### Changed
- **Onboarding no longer auto-downloads language models.** Both models on the model step now have an explicit Download button and nothing downloads on its own. The transcription (Whisper) model is required — *Next* stays disabled until the selected model is downloaded, so a speech model must be fetched before continuing, and switching the preset re-arms the requirement. The post-processing (LLM) model is optional and never blocks the wizard; a footer explains what post-processing does (cleans up the transcript — punctuation, capitalization, filler-word removal) and that a model is only needed if you want it and can be added later in Settings ([`68d1954`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/68d1954)).

## [0.3.2] — 2026-06-09

### Fixed
- **Released `.app` now launches on machines other than the build host.** Two release-only bugs left the app crashing at its first localized-string lookup — no menu bar icon, no onboarding wizard (the microphone prompt still appeared, fired earlier from the Rust bridge). First, declaring the localizations as SwiftPM `resources:` synthesized a `Bundle.module` accessor that only resolved the `.app` root (which codesign forbids content in) and the absolute build-machine path (absent on users' machines); the 0.3.1 `Contents/Resources` copy only ever worked because that build path still existed on the build host. The localizations now ship in `Contents/Resources/<lang>.lproj` and resolve through `Bundle.main`. Second, the universal-build guard matched the literal `Xcode.app`, which fails against the CI runner's versioned `Xcode_16.2.app` path, so every release was silently built arm64-only and could not launch on Intel Macs; the build now detects full Xcode by path suffix and hard-fails if a requested universal binary is not fat ([`920321b`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/920321b)).

## [0.3.1] — 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Microphone and accessibility permission controls in Settings** — a new section shows the current authorization status for both permissions and offers one-click actions to fix them: requesting microphone access (or deep-linking to the Microphone privacy pane when denied), triggering the native Accessibility prompt, and a *Reset accessibility permission* action that runs `tccutil reset Accessibility` to clear a stale TCC entry and reopens the pane so the app can be re-added cleanly ([`1b91220`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/1b91220)).
- **VoiceOver announcements and accessible controls** — dictation state changes are announced to VoiceOver, and tray/settings controls expose proper accessibility labels ([`969f617`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/969f617)).

### Changed
- **Menu bar icon is now a megaphone** (`megaphone` when idle, `megaphone.fill` while recording) instead of the waveform/mic glyphs, keeping the empty-to-filled transition as the recording cue ([`f518264`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/f518264)).
- **Onboarding blocks until both models finish downloading** — the whisper and llm models start downloading as soon as the model step is shown, and *Next* stays disabled until both report downloaded, instead of starting the download on click and letting the user advance immediately ([`be4dc87`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/be4dc87)).

### Fixed
- **Release `.app` bundles the SwiftPM resource bundle** so `Bundle.module` resolves at runtime; without it the app crashed on launch (missing localized strings) the moment the menu bar state refreshed ([`68dcffd`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/68dcffd)).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Dictation history** — every finished transcript is recorded in `history.json` next to the settings, with timestamp, mode, and a `was_cancelled` flag. Settings gains a *History* tab with an enable toggle, a configurable cap (10–1000, default 100), per-entry copy and delete buttons, and a *Clear all* action with confirmation. The tray menu gains a *Recent dictations* submenu showing the five newest entries (40-char preview, ⚠︎ marker on cancelled ones); clicking copies the full text to the clipboard without auto-pasting. Pressing Escape during dictation no longer drops the in-flight Whisper transcription — it lands in history (cancelled = true) and is simply not inserted, so accidental Escapes are recoverable ([`9ef9aff`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/9ef9aff)).
- **User-defined dictionary** — global word replacements applied to the raw transcript before any post-processing, with per-entry case-sensitive and whole-word toggles. Modes can opt out individually so a mode that needs the raw transcript stays untouched. A new *Dictionary* tab manages entries ([`de7515c`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/de7515c)).
- **Hotkey support for F13–F20, the numeric keypad, and media keys**, plus automatic re-registration when a keyboard is plugged in or out so the global hotkey survives device hotplugs ([`3ab9159`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/3ab9159)).
- **Automatic microphone fallback on hotplug** — TorroWhisper keeps a history of input devices you've actively picked. If the current mic disconnects (even mid-recording) the app seamlessly switches to the next-best mic from the history, falling back to the system default; it switches back automatically when the preferred mic returns. A short toast surfaces the change and can be turned off in Settings ([`655fdba`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/655fdba)).
- **English and German UI** with automatic selection based on the macOS system language. Source language is English; a full German translation ships alongside. A new *UI language* picker lives in Settings → Start & behavior (System / English / Deutsch; requires app restart) ([`e2579a4`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/e2579a4)).
- **Microphone switcher submenu** in the tray menu for quick switching without opening Settings ([`7b4f824`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/7b4f824)).
- **Tray menu shows the active recording hotkey** next to the *Start/Stop dictation* entry so the shortcut is always visible ([`36b7e5e`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/36b7e5e)).

### Changed
- Post-processing is now switched on and off via an "Off" entry at the top of the Modes list instead of a separate toggle ([`b1a1f40`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/b1a1f40)).
- F-key hotkey warning is now condensed to a single line under the hotkey field, with the full macOS keyboard-settings explanation moved into a hover tooltip so it no longer gets truncated inside the Settings form ([`a515142`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/a515142)).
- Dictionary settings (section header, *Add entry* button, footer hint) now resolve correctly to German, and the case-sensitive / whole-word toggles use the same localized `.help()` pattern as the rest of the codebase so their tooltips render reliably ([`f53223a`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/f53223a)).

### Fixed
- Escape is now consumed system-wide while the dictation indicator is visible, so it cancels the dictation cleanly without leaking into the underlying app ([`59800b4`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/59800b4)).
- Autostart: the registered `SMAppService` program path is refreshed on launch so Launch-at-Login keeps working after the app is moved or reinstalled into a different folder ([`c1d56d6`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/c1d56d6)).

### CI
- Release workflow publishes a GitHub Release directly instead of creating a draft ([`e1d5966`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/e1d5966)).
- Comprehensive verification pipeline added (Rust fmt/clippy, cargo-deny, CodeQL, SwiftLint) with CI documentation in [`docs/CI.md`](docs/CI.md) ([`4f43485`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/4f43485), [`543030e`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/543030e)).

## [0.2.1] — 2026-04-19

### Changed
- Mode editor refactored with post-processing summaries and a polished sidebar layout ([`2367c99`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/2367c99)).

### Added
- Help tab now shows the running app version and bundle identifier ([`ed5df92`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/ed5df92)).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-19

First public release. Everything below has landed since the project was initialised.

### Added — Auto-updates (Sparkle)
- Sparkle 2.x integrated via SwiftPM and embedded in the `.app` bundle ([`0508d38`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/0508d38), [`da23377`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/da23377)).
- `UpdaterController` wrapping `SPUStandardUpdaterController` with safety checks for non-bundle dev runs ([`9267358`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/9267358)).
- *Check for Updates…* menu-bar entry ([`17cf385`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/17cf385)) and a dedicated Updates tab in Settings ([`fd5f403`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/fd5f403)).
- Sparkle feed URL and Ed25519 public key embedded in `Info.plist` ([`c94e6da`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/c94e6da)).
- Release workflow appends a signed appcast entry to `gh-pages` on every tag ([`13fb407`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/13fb407), [`f0edc4d`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/f0edc4d)).

### Added — Post-processing
- Prompt-template Modes: create, rename, and delete post-processing Modes; a default *Cleanup* Mode ships out of the box ([`c0352bc`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/c0352bc)).
- Local LLM post-processing via `llama-cpp-2` with Gemma 4 Small/Medium/Large presets ([`0a24b32`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/0a24b32), [`7aee99f`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/7aee99f)).
- Custom GGUF models: import from a local file ([`4d7c4ad`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/4d7c4ad)) or a download URL ([`60e4a80`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/60e4a80)).
- Ollama and LM Studio models surfaced in the post-processing backend picker ([`56374d2`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/56374d2)).
- Global post-processing backend replaces the old per-Mode override as the default; Modes can still opt into a different backend individually ([`477da53`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/477da53), [`c7ca0b0`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/c7ca0b0)).
- Unified Language Models manager sheet covering both Whisper and local LLM models ([`6fde65e`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/6fde65e)).
- Gemma preset labels show their on-disk size ([`0d9b117`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/0d9b117)).

### Added — Transcription
- Whisper preset catalog expanded with **Tiny** and the **Large v3** family (Large v3, Large v3 Turbo, Large v3 Turbo Q5_0) ([`5915c55`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/5915c55)).
- Onboarding merges model selection and download into a single step ([`26614d9`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/26614d9)).
- Missing transcription model is surfaced directly on the recording indicator ([`9d5f081`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/9d5f081)).

### Added — Recording UX
- Recording indicator redesigned with a blinking dot and the active model / Mode labels ([`2467ba2`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/2467ba2), [`790133a`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/790133a)).
- Waveform style options (centered bars, line, envelope) and a color picker ([`78806e4`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/78806e4), [`2590969`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/2590969)).
- Top-center recording overlay with a distinct transcription phase ([`94f91bd`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/94f91bd)); post-processing phase made clearly visible ([`7bbb30a`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/7bbb30a)).
- Dictation cancellation, downloaded-model picker, and tray model switcher ([`22ebdfd`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/22ebdfd)).

### Added — Core functionality
- Local audio capture and `whisper.cpp` transcription ([`62d5ab5`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/62d5ab5)).
- Tray icon and global hotkey integration, including single-key hotkeys with a safety warning ([`21edc42`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/21edc42), [`2f1030c`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/2f1030c)).
- Native macOS menu-bar app with System-Settings-style UI ([`f2f6c6f`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/f2f6c6f), [`205fed5`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/205fed5)).
- Active-app text insertion via simulated paste ([`9db4ffc`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/9db4ffc)); clipboard fallback when paste is blocked ([`4b7d131`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/4b7d131)).
- Onboarding flow and permission diagnostics ([`3710095`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/3710095)); Help section to relaunch onboarding ([`9c950f7`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/9c950f7)).
- Model downloads and autostart support ([`cd560a5`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/cd560a5)).
- Auto-save settings and initial recording indicator ([`4e7f145`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/4e7f145)).
- Hotkey recorder UI ([`c272357`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/c272357)).

### Fixed
- `LocalLlm` now applies Mode prompts to the transcript instead of echoing them back ([`876c6fa`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/876c6fa)).
- Settings window `styleMask` is clamped so SwiftUI cannot re-enable `fullSizeContentView` ([`d456c06`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/d456c06), [`fd4b4a9`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/fd4b4a9)).
- Tray menu cleaned up by removing redundant status entries ([`329440c`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/329440c)).
- Hard-check `sign_update` and separate Quit entry in the tray menu ([`d632990`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/d632990)).

### CI & infrastructure
- GitHub Actions CI and release workflows plus MIT LICENSE ([`4bda7cf`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/4bda7cf)).
- macOS packaging scripts and app icon ([`056d39a`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/056d39a)).
- CI runner bumped to `macos-15` for a newer Metal.framework ([`47caf7d`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/47caf7d)); Xcode 16 pinned on `macos-14` for Swift 6 ([`a1a2b63`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/a1a2b63)).
- Legacy egui desktop app removed ([`82a3f6d`](https://github.com/mahype/TorroWhisper/commit/82a3f6d)).
