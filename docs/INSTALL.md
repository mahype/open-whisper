# Installation

## macOS

### Requirements

- macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later
- Apple Silicon (M1 or newer) or Intel x86_64

### Install

1. Download **`OpenWhisper-<version>.dmg`** from the [latest release](https://github.com/mahype/open-whisper/releases/latest).
2. Open the DMG and drag **Open Whisper.app** into the **Applications** folder.
3. Launch Open Whisper from Launchpad or Spotlight.
4. On first launch, macOS will verify the notarized signature. If you see a Gatekeeper warning instead of a regular launch, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below.
5. Follow the in-app onboarding — it walks you through mic selection, model download, and startup behavior.

Open Whisper runs as a **menu bar app**. Look for its icon in the top-right of your screen — there is no Dock icon.

### Permissions

Open Whisper needs three macOS permissions. You'll be prompted for each the first time it's needed; grant all three for the full feature set.

| Permission | Why | Where to re-enable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Microphone** | Record what you say | System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone |
| **Accessibility** | Insert transcribed text into the active app via simulated paste | System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility |
| **Input Monitoring** | Register the global hotkey | System Settings → Privacy & Security → Input Monitoring |

If you deny a permission by accident, quit Open Whisper, flip the toggle in System Settings, and relaunch. The in-app **Permissions** panel shows the current status of each.

### Start at login (autostart)

You have two equivalent ways to enable this:

- **In the app:** open Settings → *Startup* and choose **Launch at login**. The app registers itself as a macOS Login Item and launches hidden (menu bar only) on every sign-in.
- **In System Settings:** open System Settings → General → Login Items → toggle **Open Whisper** under *Open at Login*.

To disable autostart, flip either switch back off. You can also choose **Ask on first launch** in Settings to have Open Whisper show the prompt the next time you start it manually.

> **Note:** Autostart only works when Open Whisper is installed in `/Applications` or `~/Applications`. If you run it from a different folder (e.g., your Downloads), move the app first.

### Update

Download the new DMG and drag the updated app over the old one. Your settings (in `~/Library/Application Support/open-whisper/`) are preserved.

### Uninstall

1. Quit Open Whisper (menu bar icon → *Quit*).
2. In Settings → *Startup*, switch to **Manual launch** to unregister the Login Item. (Alternatively, remove it under System Settings → General → Login Items.)
3. Move **Open Whisper.app** from Applications to the Trash.
4. Optional — remove user data:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/open-whisper
   rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/open-whisper
   ```
5. Optional — revoke permissions under System Settings → Privacy & Security.

### Troubleshooting

**"Open Whisper can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software."**
This means you downloaded an unsigned development build (e.g., a CI artifact) instead of a notarized release. Either grab the official DMG from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mahype/open-whisper/releases), or right-click the app → *Open* → *Open* to bypass Gatekeeper for unsigned builds at your own risk.

**Hotkey doesn't trigger recording.**
Most often a missing **Input Monitoring** permission. Open System Settings → Privacy & Security → Input Monitoring and confirm Open Whisper is listed and enabled. If it is and things still don't work, toggle it off and on again.

**Transcribed text doesn't appear in the target app.**
That's the **Accessibility** permission — the app needs it to simulate the paste shortcut. Same location in System Settings.

**App didn't start after login even though autostart is on.**
Check that Open Whisper is in `/Applications` or `~/Applications`. macOS's `SMAppService` API refuses to register Login Items for apps outside those locations.

## Windows

Coming soon. The Rust bridge already compiles on Windows; a native UI shell is on the roadmap.

## Linux

The GTK4 shell is under active development. Binary packages are not published yet; see [LINUX.md](LINUX.md) for the current feature status, runtime dependencies, GNOME tray setup, and the `GSK_RENDERER=cairo` workaround needed on NVIDIA + Wayland.
