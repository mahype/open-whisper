# Development

## Prerequisites

You need a Mac running macOS 14+ with:

- **Xcode Command Line Tools** — `xcode-select --install`
- **Swift 6** — bundled with Xcode 16+. Verify with `swift --version`.
- **Rust toolchain** — install via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/). Edition 2024 plus transitive deps (`whisper-rs-sys`, `llama-cpp-sys-2`, `image`) require stable **1.88+**.
- **CMake** — required to build the bundled `whisper.cpp` and `llama.cpp`: `brew install cmake`.
- For universal binaries (release builds): full Xcode (not just Command Line Tools) and both Rust targets installed:
  ```bash
  rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin x86_64-apple-darwin
  ```

Optional but recommended:
- `create-dmg` (for local DMG packaging): `brew install create-dmg`

## Clone and run

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mahype/open-whisper.git
cd open-whisper
./scripts/dev.sh
```

`dev.sh` is the fast iteration loop:

1. `cargo build -p open-whisper-bridge` — produces `target/debug/libopen_whisper_bridge.a`
2. `swift run --package-path apps/open-whisper-macos OpenWhisperMac` — launches the app

The Swift package links against `target/debug/libopen_whisper_bridge.a` via the hard-coded linker flag in [Package.swift](../apps/open-whisper-macos/Package.swift). Release builds go through the build script below instead.

> **Heads-up:** when launched via `swift run`, the executable runs outside a `.app` bundle. The SMAppService-based autostart path is disabled in that mode — a LaunchAgent fallback is used. For realistic autostart testing, build the bundle (next section).

## Build a local `.app` bundle

```bash
./scripts/build-macos-app.sh
open dist/Open\ Whisper.app
```

This produces a **universal** (Apple Silicon + Intel), **release** build, and assembles a complete bundle at `dist/Open Whisper.app` with Info.plist, entitlements, and resources. The bundle is signed **ad-hoc** by default — good enough to run on your own machine, but Gatekeeper will flag it on other Macs. For a proper signed + notarized build, see [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).

## FFI header

The C header at [apps/open-whisper-macos/Bridge/OpenWhisperBridgeFFI.h](../apps/open-whisper-macos/Bridge/OpenWhisperBridgeFFI.h) is **hand-maintained** — we don't currently auto-generate it with cbindgen. When you add or change an `extern "C"` function in `crates/open-whisper-bridge/src/lib.rs`, update the header by hand and keep the shape in sync.

Convention: every function takes UTF-8 JSON strings and returns a newly allocated UTF-8 JSON string owned by the caller. The caller must free it via `ow_string_free`.

## Debugging

### Rust logs

Set `RUST_LOG` before launching:

```bash
RUST_LOG=info ./scripts/dev.sh
RUST_LOG=open_whisper_bridge=debug ./scripts/dev.sh
```

Logs go to stderr, which Xcode / Console.app / your terminal will display depending on how you launched.

### Swift side

Attach a debugger with Xcode:

1. Run `./scripts/dev.sh` to produce the build artifacts.
2. In Xcode, **Debug → Attach to Process by PID or Name…** → `OpenWhisperMac`.

Or add breakpoints and launch from Xcode directly by opening the Swift package folder.

### Settings and model files

Runtime data is written to:

- `~/Library/Application Support/open-whisper/settings.json`
- `~/Library/Application Support/open-whisper/models/*.bin`

Deleting these resets the app to a fresh-install state — handy for testing onboarding.

## Running tests

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

Swift tests are not currently set up. When they are, `swift test --package-path apps/open-whisper-macos` will be the entry point.

## Style and CI

- Rust: `cargo fmt` + `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`
- Commits: keep the subject line imperative; reference any related issue.

GitHub Actions runs `cargo fmt --check`, clippy, and `cargo test --workspace` on every push and PR. See [.github/workflows/ci.yml](../.github/workflows/ci.yml).
